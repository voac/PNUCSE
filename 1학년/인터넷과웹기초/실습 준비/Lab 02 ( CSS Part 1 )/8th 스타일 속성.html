        <p class="p1"><span>Hmmm</span> Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 ~ 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Turing</strong> was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
