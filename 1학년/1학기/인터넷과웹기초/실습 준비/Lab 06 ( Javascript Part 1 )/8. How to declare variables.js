// var, let
// Declare variables, and the stored values can be changed during runtime of the JS code.

// const
// Declare CONSTANT variable, and the stored value cannot be changed.

// (nothing)
// Without var, let, const, a variable can still be created.

var score; // declare variable "score"
var year, month, day; // declare three variables: year, month, day
var address = "Busan"; // declare variable "address" and initialize with "Busan"

// let is same as above.

const PI = 3.141592;

PI = PI + 10; // This will also give an error

// We don't need to consider the data type while using JS.

// JS variable can be used to store different data types DYNAMICALLY.
